This is a WIP Discord bot dedicated to tournament organization and management on servers.

Previously worked as a [cog](https://github.com/retke/Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs) for
[Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot), it is now developed as a
standalone [2.0 discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) bot.
